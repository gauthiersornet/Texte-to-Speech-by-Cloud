# Texte-to-Speech-by-Google-Cloud
This software source code has been written very quickly so as to transform any text to a serie of audio MP3 files. It lets us make audio's books from text's books or any text that need to become a speech !  First of all, you have to instal the google cloud SDK (https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/GoogleCloudSDKInstaller.exe). Then, you have to open a google cloud account (from any gmail account : https://cloud.google.com/?hl=fr). Thus, you will be able to activate the text to speech API from your account and generate an account key file. The path of this file must be referenced from the environnement variables "GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS".  Then, the script "C:/Users/<USER>/AppData/Local/Google/Cloud SDK/google-cloud-sdk/bin/gcloud.cmd" will be able to generate a key to query the TTS API by your gougle cloud account.
